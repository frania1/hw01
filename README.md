Hello! My name is Frania Mendoza Lua, I am a second year **PHD student** at the *School of Social Administration*. 

I study:

*immigration

*teens

*teen health behaviors

#What am I doing across the Midway?
I am taking this course because I am tinkering with an idea of incorporating tech into the work that I do. 

#Why I study teens?
I study teens because it is such an important developmental period that shapes the trajectory of our lives. For example, check out this [embarassing video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBZ_jYmedBI) of me doing my first interview on TV as a teen, it haunts me til this day.  

#The Weather
##OMG Chicago weather; the Midwestern small talk topic
As a Southern Californian, growing up 15 minutes (30 with traffic) from the beach, living in Chicago is brutal. Naively, I chose a place 3 blocks from the lake thinking, I made it, I finally live by the water. It's a sham! I didn't know what a lake effect was until now. Living by the lake is nice for like two months, the rest of it is a mixture of sadness, coldness, and the ever ending temptation of wanting to take a walk on the lakefront but realizing its March. I low key get offended when Chicagoans call the lake a beach, and don't you dare call it a coast. Here is a picture of a real beach:
